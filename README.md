# XorCrypt
This is a simple Symmetric Encryption system using the XOR operator

Instructions
- Write the text you wanna Encrypt/Decrypt.
- Generate a key that will Encrypt/Decrypt the text.
     - You can generate an AutoSize key or define the size manually. I really recommend to use the AutoSize feature if you don't know the size of the text.
- Once you have the key, you just have to Encrypt/Decrypt the text.
