# XorCrypt
This is a simple Symmetric Encryption system using the XOR operator

- 1. Write the text you wanna Ecrypt/Decrypt.
- 2. Generate a key that will Ecrypt/Decrypt the text.
     - 2.1 You can generate an AutoSize key or define the size manually. I really recommend to use the AutoSize feature if you don't know the size of the text.
- 3. Once you have the key, you just have to Encrypt/Decrypt the text.
